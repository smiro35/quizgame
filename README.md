The purpose here is to create a Quiz app that displays the instractions in the begining, and then the answers when the start button is clicked. 

The app should have a timer and rate the scores based on this timer: so when a person clicks on the wrong answer, we deduct 5 seconds and vice versa. 

The total number of seconds left will be the score and has to be displayed on another page. 

Total scores will need to be ranked and saved on the user's local storage.
